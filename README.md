# ODRE-Framework

This project is part of the research effort conducted by the [Ontology Engineering Group (OEG)](https://oeg.fi.upm.es/) at the [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)](https://www.upm.es/). Our main objective is to explore and develop solutions that use ODRL to run privacy policies in digital environments, achieving transparency and control over the use of personal data.

The implementations in this repository are mainly developed in [Python](https://github.com/ODRE-Framework/odre-python) and [Java](https://github.com/ODRE-Framework/odre-java). Both the libraries and the examples you will find here are intended for researchers, developers and professionals interested in applying ODRL in their systems.

### Objetives

 - Applied research
 - Practical solutions. 
 - Academic and industry collaboration.

### How to contribute

You are welcome to participate in the project. If you have ideas, suggestions or find bugs, feel free to create an issue or make a pull request. We want to build a community around the use of ODRL.
